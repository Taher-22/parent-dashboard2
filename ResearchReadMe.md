# 📚 Research Branch Guide

Welcome to the **research branch** of our project!

This branch is dedicated to all research and experimental activities that support the main project, including literature review, AI/model experimentation, documentation of findings, and preparation of supporting materials for the team and supervisors.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

The research branch is used for:
- Exploring and testing new technologies, workflows, or ideas
- Documenting experiments, results, and recommendations
- Preparing materials and evidence for project decisions
- Keeping research separate from production game logic

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

To keep all research organized and accessible, always use these main folders:

- **presentations/**  
  Store all slides and visual presentations prepared for team meetings, supervisor reviews, or public sharing.

- **word-docs/**  
  Save all editable Word documents, drafts, and templates here. This includes any interim writeups or formal research documents.

- **reports/**  
  Archive all finalized reports, findings, comparisons, literature reviews, and major deliverables in markdown or PDF format.

---

## 📝 Best Practices

- Always create a clear folder and filename for each research topic (e.g., `llm-benchmarking.md`, `accessibility-review.docx`, `edge-ai-slides.pptx`).
- Date and sign major contributions or documents for easy tracking.
- Summarize your findings at the top of each report or document.
- Only move work to the main development branch after review and team approval.

## 👀 For Observers & Supervisors

This branch is open for inspection, feedback, and review by all team members and supervisors. Please browse the folders to see ongoing and completed research work. Feedback and new research directions are always welcome.
