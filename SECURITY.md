## 🐞 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you've discovered a security vulnerability, please follow the steps below:

1. **Report via Email**: Send your detailed security report directly to the project maintainer at **[your-email@example.com]**.
2. **Include Details**:
   - Clear description of the issue.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Potential impact.
   - Suggested fix, if possible.

### ⏳ Response Time

We aim to respond to all vulnerability reports within **3 working days**. After initial acknowledgment, you can expect regular updates approximately every **7 days** until the vulnerability is resolved.

### ✅ Vulnerability Resolution

- **Accepted Issues**: We will acknowledge, confirm, and address accepted security issues promptly, providing credit to the reporter if desired.
- **Declined Issues**: If we consider the reported vulnerability invalid or out-of-scope, we will explain clearly why the issue will not be addressed.

### 🔐 Confidentiality

We kindly ask that you do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until we've had an opportunity to resolve them.

Thank you for contributing to the security of our project!
